Decided to give my engineer thesis another try and see if I can beat my last score with the data I kept on my google drive.
There's a few improvements I think I can apply straight away, like feature engineering, for example NPads can is values 1-192,
so maybe normilizing it isnt the best idea. I will go with XGBoost coz it's "the thing" these days.
I'm also thinking HARD of XYZ coords. These are traces of particles after all, maybe there's a way to group individual traces together,
instead of trying to classify individual points...
